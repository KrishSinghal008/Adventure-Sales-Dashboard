" Adventure Work Sales Dashboard "

I recently created an Adventure Works Sales Dashboard in Excel, designed to provide a comprehensive view of key sales metrics and business performance.

In this project, I applied data cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization techniques Dax queries and measures using Excel, including pivot tables and Power Query, to derive valuable insights from sales data. Below are some of the key analyses and findings:

Total Revenue, Profit, and Transaction for years exceeding the average performance.

3. Monthly Profit Trends:
Analyzing profit trends on a monthly basis.

4. Profit by Week Type:
